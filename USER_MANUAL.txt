========================================

Welcome! This document is your all-in-one guide to managing, updating, and understanding your Thrift by Musk website.

---
### 1. Quick Setup Checklist
---
For first-time setup or major configuration changes, follow this checklist.

- [ ] **Product Sheet:** Created in Google Sheets with the correct headers.
- [ ] **Publish Product Sheet:** Published to the web as a CSV file.
- [ ] **Update `constants.ts`:**
    - [ ] `GOOGLE_SHEET_CSV_URL` is filled with the published CSV link.
    - [ ] **(Recommended)** `GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL` is filled with your deployed web app link (see Section 4.3).

    - [ ] `launchDate` is configured for your next product drop.

### 2. Website Map & Architecture
---
This section explains how your website is built. Think of it like a blueprint.

#### The "Control Panel" (`constants.ts`)
This is the most important file for store management. It's designed so you can change key parts of your site without touching complex code. Here you control:
-   Your Product Sheet link.
-   Your automated order submission URL.
-   Your brand logo, owner photos, and promotional images.
-   Your Instagram handle.
-   The countdown timer for new drops.

#### The "Data Engine" (Google Sheets & `productService.ts`)
-   **Products Sheet (CSV):** This is your master product database.
-   **`services/productService.ts`:** This is the code that fetches your CSV file from the `GOOGLE_SHEET_CSV_URL`. It reads and parses the data, delivering the final product list to the website.

#### The "Brain" (Context Providers)
These are special components that hold and manage the website's state (data that can change).
-   **`ProductContext.tsx`:** Holds all the products after they've been fetched and processed.
-   **`CartContext.tsx`:** Manages everything related to the shopping cart (items, total price, etc.).
-   **`ThemeContext.tsx`:** Manages the Light/Dark/Sepia theme switching.
-   **`DropContext.tsx`:** Manages the countdown timer and knows when a drop is "live".

#### The "Pages" (Main Components)
-   **`HomePage.tsx`:** The landing page. It's built from smaller section components found in `components/home/`.
-   **`ShopPage.tsx`:** Displays all products with powerful search and filtering.
-   **`ProductDetailPage.tsx`:** Shows all details, images, and video for a single item. It also automatically displays a "You Might Also Like" section at the bottom to encourage further browsing.
-   **`GalleryPage.tsx`:** A simple, beautiful page to showcase your style photos.

### 3. Content Management
---
How to perform day-to-day updates on your store.

#### 3.1 Managing Products
1.  **Open your "Products" Google Sheet.**
2.  To add a new item, add a new row and fill in all the columns, including a full `description`.
3.  **To add images/video:** Upload them to Google Drive, get the "Anyone with the link" shareable link, and paste it into the `imageUrls` or `videoUrl` columns. For multiple images, separate URLs with a comma.
4.  **Important:** The sheet is automatically re-fetched when a user visits the site. Your changes will appear live.

#### 3.2 Receiving Orders
There are three ways a customer can place an order.

**Method 1: Automated Orders (Recommended)**
If you have set up the Google Apps Script (see Section 4.3), this is the primary method.
1.  A customer clicks "Confirm & Place Order".
2.  The website sends the order details to your script.
3.  A new row is **automatically added** to the "Orders" sheet in your Google Spreadsheet.
4.  You can then review this sheet, see new orders, and contact the customer to arrange payment and shipping.

**Method 2 & 3: Manual Orders (WhatsApp & Instagram)**
These are fallback options for the customer.
1.  The customer clicks "Order via WhatsApp" or "Order via Instagram DM".
2.  This opens the respective app with a **pre-filled message** containing the customer's shipping details AND their full order summary.
3.  The customer sends this message to you. You can then coordinate payment and shipping directly.

**What You Receive (Manual Methods):**
You will get a message on WhatsApp or Instagram that looks like this:

> Hello Thrift by Musk! I'd like to place the following order:
>
> *ORDER SUMMARY*
>
> - Product: Vintage Cream Blouse
>   ID: vintage-cream-blouse
>   Size: M
>   Category: Tops
>   Price: ₹1,299
>
> *SHIPPING DETAILS*
> Name: Riya Sharma
> Phone: 9876543210
> Address: 123 Green Lane, Sector 15, Delhi, Delhi - 110001
>
> *Total:* ₹1,299

#### 3.3 Managing Site-Wide Assets (Logo, Banners, etc.)
1.  **Upload your image** (e.g., new logo) to Google Drive.
2.  Get the **"Anyone with the link"** shareable link.
3.  Open `constants.ts` in the code, find the variable (e.g., `LOGO_URL`), and replace the old link with your new one.

### 4. Setup & Troubleshooting
---

#### 4.1. Common Problems

*   **A product isn't showing up?**
    *   → In your Product Sheet, check that `sold` is `FALSE` and `isUpcoming` is `FALSE`. Also ensure it has a unique `id` and a valid `price`.

*   **Images, logo, or other assets are not visible?**
    *   → The Google Drive share link is likely incorrect. Make sure it's set to **"Anyone with the link"**.

*   **The countdown timer is wrong or has ended early?**
    *   → The `launchDate` in `constants.ts` is in UTC time. Make sure you've converted your local time to UTC. For example, `5:30 PM IST` is `12:00 PM UTC`.
    
*   **"Confirm & Place Order" button is missing or disabled?**
    *   → This means you have not filled in the `GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL` in `constants.ts`. Follow the setup guide below.

*   **Customer says WhatsApp/Instagram button doesn't work?**
    *   → This is expected on desktop browsers if the app isn't installed. The order message is automatically copied to their clipboard, so they can easily paste it into WhatsApp Web or the Instagram website.

#### 4.2. Finding Your Google Sheet ID

You need this ID for the Apps Script setup.
1. Open your Products Google Sheet.
2. Look at the URL in your browser's address bar. It will look like this:
   `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/THIS_IS_YOUR_ID/edit`
3. Copy the long string of letters and numbers between `/d/` and `/edit`. That is your Sheet ID.

#### 4.3. Setting Up Automated Orders (Google Apps Script)

Follow these steps carefully to enable automated order logging.

1.  **Go to your Products Google Sheet.**
2.  In the top menu, click **Extensions > Apps Script**. A new browser tab will open with the script editor.
3.  In the script editor, delete all the code in the `Code.gs` file.
4.  Open the `ORDER_APPS_SCRIPT.js` file from your website project code. Copy its entire content.
5.  Paste this content into the empty `Code.gs` file in the Apps Script editor.
6.  **IMPORTANT:** Near the top of the script, find the line `var SPREADSHEET_ID = "YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEET_ID_HERE";` and replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEET_ID_HERE` with your actual Google Sheet ID (see section 4.2).
7.  Click the **Save project** icon (looks like a floppy disk).
8.  Click the blue **Deploy** button in the top-right, then select **New deployment**.
9.  Click the gear icon next to "Select type" and choose **Web app**.
10. Fill out the deployment configuration:
    *   **Description:** `Thrift by Musk Order Handler` (or similar)
    *   **Execute as:** `Me (your-email@gmail.com)`
    *   **Who has access:** `Anyone` (This is critical for the website to be able to send data to it).
11. Click **Deploy**.
12. **Authorize Access:** A new window will pop up asking for permission.
    *   Click **Authorize access**.
    *   Choose your Google account.
    *   You will likely see a warning screen saying "Google hasn't verified this app". This is normal. Click **Advanced**, then click **Go to [Your Project Name] (unsafe)**.
    *   Click **Allow** on the final screen.
13. After authorization, you will see a "Deployment successfully updated" message with a **Web app URL**. Click the **Copy** button to copy this URL.
14. **Final Step:** Open `constants.ts` in your website code. Paste the copied URL into the `GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL` variable.

That's it! Your website is now connected to your Google Sheet for automated orders. A new sheet named "Orders" will be created automatically when the first order is placed.
